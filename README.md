In this project, I will create a chatbot for your own pdf file using Flask, a popular web framework, and the Langchain, another popular framework for working wtih Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The chatbot I develop will not just interact with users via text but also comprehend and answer questions related to the content of a specific document with the help of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
